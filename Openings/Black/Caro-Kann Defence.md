## General structure
The Caro-Kann Defence is a solid set-up based opening for black. The two opening moves are the following. The ECO classification of the main Caro-Kann Defence is B10, and looks the following:
```chess
orientation: black
fen: rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3
```

## Variations
### Exchange Variation
In the exchange variation white captures the pawn on d5:
```pgn
orientation: black
1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5
```
The general idea of the exchange variation is to focus on the queen's side (a,b,c file). Here we can make use of the a and b pawn to lead a minority attack. We can use the half open c-file with the rook to further help the attack.
We follow-up with basic development putting the pieces on logical squares and casteling king's side. Note that we only play e6 whenever our white bishop is developed.

```chess
orientation: black
fen: rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4
arrows: b8->c6 g8->f6 c8->g4 e7->e6 f8->e7 a8->c8 
squares: g4 
```

### Advance Variation

```pgn
orientation: black
1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5
```
