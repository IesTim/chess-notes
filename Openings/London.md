# London System
The London system is a solid opening for white. It is notorious for its simple ideas and solid structure. 
## General Set-up
The general setup for white is the following:

```chess
fen: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P1B2/2PBPN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 10 9
```

We create a strong pawn triangle towards the center of the board. For now we leave the king in the middle of the board. Depending on what black does we can castle either side, or leave the king in the middle. 
## 1. General Ideas
Whenever black challenges the dark squared bishop we play bg3:

```pgn
[Event "?"]
[Site "?"]
[Date "????.??.??"]
[Round "?"]
[White "?"]
[Black "?"]
[Result "*"]

1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nc6 3. e3 e6 4. Nf3 Bd6 5. Bg3 Bxg3 6. hxg3 *
```

This allows us to open the h file. This can lead to some devious attacks.
